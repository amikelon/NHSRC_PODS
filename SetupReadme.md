~~~Readme for getting Arduino Code installed and usable~~~
// Author-Hawes Collier \\
1. Install Arduino if not already done
2. Open ISCO code in Arduino
3. Open Sketch --> Include Library--> Manage libraries  (Or hit Ctrl+Shift+I)
4. Install Adafruit SleepyDog Library, Adafruit FONA Libary, Ubidots FONA Libary
5.  You will likely need to uninstall SD from C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries if you get the "Multiple Libraries" error
6.  The rest for now I need to go debug and clean up.  Some of this code has errors that prevent compilation.  I will update accordingly to 
future fixes
