~~~Readme for getting Arduino Code installed and usable~~~
// Author-Hawes Collier \\
1. Install TeensyDuino if not already done
1a. Download Ubidots_FONATim.zip
2. Open ISCO code in Arduino
3a. Open Sketch --> Include Library--> Add .ZIP Library--> Select Ubidots_FONATim.zip
3b. Open Sketch --> Include Library--> scroll to and select Ubidots_FONA
3c. Open Sketch --> Include Library-->scroll to and select Time Library
4. You will likely need to uninstall SD from C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\libraries if you get the "Multiple Libraries" error
5.  The rest for now I need to go debug and clean up.  Some of this code has errors that prevent compilation.  I will update accordingly to future fixes.
